# Virtual Vehicle Simulation

This project simulates a modern automotive system for testing purposes. It mocks Electronic Control Units (ECUs), physical plant models, and the communication bus to enable comprehensive verification of software logic, safety mechanisms, and cybersecurity features.

## Structure

*   **ecus/**: Virtual ECUs containing application logic (e.g., BMS, ACC, Gateway).
*   **plants/**: Physics models of the vehicle components (e.g., Battery, Motor, Radar).
*   **sim/**: The simulation engine and communication bus (Virtual CAN/Ethernet).
*   **tests/**: Test suites for various domains (Safety, Security, ADAS).

## Usage

(Instructions to be added as the simulation framework is built)
